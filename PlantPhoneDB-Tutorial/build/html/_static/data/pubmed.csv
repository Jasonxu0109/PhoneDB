While single-cell RNA-seq provides a wealth of information regarding cell states, better methods are needed to map their identity, especially during developmental transitions. Here, we use repositories of cell type-specific transcriptomes to quantify identities from single-cell RNA-seq profiles, accurately classifying cells from Arabidopsis root tips and human glioblastoma tumors. We apply our approach to single cells captured from regenerating roots following tip excision. Our technique exposes a previously uncharacterized transient collapse of identity distant from the injury site, demonstrating the biological relevance of a quantitative cell identity index.

To determine which developmental program mediates such repair, we applied a combination of lineage tracing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and marker analysis to test different models of tissue reassembly. We show that multiple cell types can reconstitute stem cells, demonstrating the latent potential of untreated plant cells. The transcriptome of regenerating cells prior to stem cell activation resembles that of an embryonic root progenitor. Regeneration defects are more severe in embryonic than in adult root mutants. Furthermore, the signaling domains of the hormones auxin and cytokinin mirror their embryonic dynamics and manipulation of both hormones alters the position of new tissues and stem cell niche markers. Our findings suggest that plant root regeneration follows, on a larger scale, the developmental stages of embryonic patterning and is guided by spatial information provided by complementary hormone domains.

Diffusion pseudotime analyses revealed the differentiating trajectory of vessels, fiber cells and ray parenchyma cells and indicated a different differentiation process between vessels and fiber cells, and a similar differentiation process between fiber cells and ray parenchyma cells. We identified marker genes for each cell type (cluster) and key candidate regulators during developmental stages of xylem cell differentiation. Our study generates a high resolution expression atlas of wood formation at the single cell level and provides valuable information on wood formation.",Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals a high-resolution cell atlas of xylem in Populus,J Integr Plant Biol,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34347368

Yet, much is unknown regarding how a cell traverses the pathway from stem cell to terminal differentiation. Advances in single cell genomics hold promise for unraveling developmental mechanisms in tissues, organs, and organisms. However, lineage tracing can be challenging for some tissues and integration of high-quality datasets is often necessary to detect rare cell populations and developmental states. Here, we harmonized single cell mRNA sequencing data from over 110,000 cells to construct a comprehensive atlas for a stereotypically developing organ with indeterminate growth, the Arabidopsis root. To test the utility of the atlas to interpret new datasets, we profiled mutants for two key transcriptional regulators at single cell resolution, shortroot and scarecrow. Although both transcription factors are required for early specification of cell identity, our results suggest the existence of an alternative pathway acting in mature cells to specify endodermal identity, for which SHORTROOT is required. Uncovering the architecture of this pathway will provide insight into specification and stabilization of the endodermis, a tissue analogous to the mammalian epithelium. Thus, the atlas is a pivotal advance for unraveling the transcriptional programs that specify and maintain cell identity to regulate organ development in space and time.",A single cell Arabidopsis root atlas reveals developmental trajectories in wild type and cell identity mutants,bioRxiv,2020,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.178863

Recent advances in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have enabled profiling gene expression pattern of heterogenous tissues and organs at single cellular level and have been widely applied in human and animal research. Nevertheless, the existence of cell walls significantly encumbered its application in plant research. Protoplasts have been applied for scRNA-seq analysis, but mostly restricted to tissues amenable for wall digestion, such as root tips. However, many cell types are resistant to protoplasting, and protoplasting may yield ectopic gene expression and bias proportions of cell types. Here we demonstrate a method with minimal artifacts for high-throughput single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq) that we use to profile tomato shoot apex cells. The obtained high-resolution expression atlas identifies numerous distinct cell types covering major shoot tissues and developmental stages, delineates developmental trajectories of mesophyll cells, vasculature cells, epidermal cells, and trichome cells. In addition, we identify key developmental regulators and reveal their hierarchy. Collectively, this study demonstrates the power of snRNA-seq to plant research and provides an unprecedented spatiotemporal gene expression atlas of heterogeneous shoot cells.",Single-nucleus RNA-seq resolves spatiotemporal developmental trajectories in the tomato shoot apex,bioRxiv,2020,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.20.305029v1

However, cells with various functions are often studied as a bulk where their specificities were diluted. Here, we apply single-cell RNA sequencing to the aerial part of rice seedlings growing in various environments. We capture the transcriptomes of thousands of cells, identify all major cell types, and reconstruct their developmental trajectories. We find that abiotic stresses not only affect gene expression in a cell-type-specific manner but also have impacts on the physical size of cells and the composition of cell populations. We validate some of these conclusions with microscopy and provide developmental mechanisms with computational analyses. Collectively, our study represents a benchmark-setting data resource of single-cell transcriptome atlas in rice and an illustration of exploiting such resource to drive discoveries in plant biology.",Single-cell transcriptome analyses recapitulate the cellular and developmental responses to abiotic stresses in rice,bioRxiv,2020,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.926329
