PlantPhoneDB is a ligand-receptor interactions database, which aims to infer cell-cell communications from scRNA-seq datasets in plant. We built the PlantPhoneDB web interface to present the results we analyzed in a flexible way based on shiny (www.rstudio.com/shiny), a web application framework for R.
