Ligand-Receptor Interaction Pairs
--------------------------------------
The current PlantPhoneDB contains 3,514 unique reliable ligand-receptor pairs for Arabidopsis thaliana, which curated from seven resources, including plant.MAP, Interactome2.0, IntAct, BioGRID, Text-mining, STRING and Orthologs resources.

By assigning orthologs of ligand-receptor pairs between Arabidopsis thaliana and other four plant species proteomes using the InParanoid algorithm, the number of ligand-receptor pairs identified ranged from 1,751 (Solanum lycopersicum) to 3,762 (Oryza sativa).

Expression matrix
--------------------------------------
We kept the datasets with â‰¥ 1000 high-quality cells, which considered to be PASS datasets. In addition, PASS datasets without available expression matrix or with a large number of cells that consume high memory on our laptop were considered to be pending datasets. The rest of scRNA-seq datasets were considered to be FAIL datasets (< 1000 high-quality cells).

We provides `13 PASS processed scRNA-seq datasets <https://github.com/Jasonxu0109/PlantPhoneDB/releases>`_.
